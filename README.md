# Household-Power-Consumption
This report contains descriptive analytics and univariate time series forecasting of the Household Power Consumption Dataset. This dataset describes electricity consumption for a single household over four years, including energy measurements taken for every minute between 12-16-2006 and 12-11-2010.

## Goals
The focus of this analysis will be on global_active_power: the total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).

### Visualization
* Perform descriptive analytics on the global_active_power variable
* Plot time series of global_active_power over the entire four year timeframe
* Plot average monthly global active power
* Plot typical daily consumption by month

### Forecasting
Apply and evaluate the following forecasting methods to the global_active_power time series:

* Linear Regression (perfomed only as an exercise - not applicable to this dataset)
* Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARINA)
* Prophet Forecasting Procedure
